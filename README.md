# Zahra Transformer Experiment

## Overview
This repository contains experiments with a custom Transformer-based language model.  
The goal is to explore model training, evaluation, and inference quality using a lightweight architecture.



Training & Evaluation
Training was conducted on a custom dataset with tokenized text sequences.

Evaluation metric: Perplexity

Current model perplexity: 12,498.951 (very high, indicating poor predictive performance).

High perplexity suggests issues with dataset quality, model capacity, or training stability.

Inference Results
Example inference output shows grammatically valid but semantically incoherent text:

inference
"...superman, and the latter was to be one of the most popular culture. 
The first book by the United States, in a review for the film's development, was released on June 13, 2011..."
This reflects the high perplexity score — the model generates plausible sentences but lacks coherence.

Usage
Python
Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Yasar26951/zahra.git
cd zahra
pip install -r requirements.txt
python infer.py --prompt "Your text here"
## Model Configuration
